title: Context Menu
---

A context menu offers the actions of one thing on the screen — a picture, a row, a file — where the thing is. On a
touch screen a long press opens it: the rest of the window dims, the thing stays bright, and the menu appears below
it, as on iOS. On a desktop the secondary mouse button opens it at the pointer.

## Usage

`ui.ContextMenu(content, items...)` takes the same items as a [Menu](../menu/):

```go
ui.ContextMenu(
	ui.Image(photo).Frame(200, 150).CornerRadius(12).Clip(true),
	ui.MenuItem("Copy", copyPhoto).Icon(outline.FileCopy),
	ui.MenuItem("Delete", deletePhoto).Icon(outline.TrashBin).Destructive(),
).CornerRadius(12)
```

`CornerRadius` tells the menu the shape of its content, so that the window dims around it exactly.

## The long press

After `gift.LongPressDelay`, half a second, the menu opens while the finger is still down, and the finger can slide
on onto an item and lift there, as in a [Menu](../menu/). The long press takes the finger from whatever content
captured it: a button inside the context menu is told its press was cancelled and does not fire on the release. A
short tap is the content's as before.

On a desktop the secondary mouse button sends a `gift.EventContextMenu` to the node under the pointer, which bubbles
to the context menu around it. The menu then opens at the pointer and nothing dims.
