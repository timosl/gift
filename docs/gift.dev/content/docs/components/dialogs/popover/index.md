title: Popover
---

A popover shows a small view in a card next to the view it belongs to, with an arrow that points at it: a hint,
details, a few settings. It appears below its anchor when it fits there and above otherwise, always inside the
window, and grows out of the arrow with a spring when it opens and shrinks back into it when it closes, as on iOS.

{{< gallery-shot alt="A button labelled Opening hours with a white card below it whose arrow points at the button, showing the opening hours" >}}

{{< gallery-code >}}

## Usage

`ui.Popover(anchor, content)` wraps the anchor and presents the content while `Presented` is true. The application
owns that flag, like the presentation of a [Modal](../modal/):

```go
open := ctx.State("info", false)
ui.Popover(
	ui.Button(ui.Text("Info"), func() { open.Set(true) }),
	ui.Text("Opening hours: 9 to 17"),
).Presented(ctx.Read(open)).OnDismiss(func() { open.Set(false) })
```

A press outside the card or escape calls `OnDismiss`; that press goes nowhere else, so the first tap next to an open
popover only closes it. While the popover is open the keyboard focus is trapped inside it.

`Edge` prefers a side — `EdgeBelow`, `EdgeAbove`, `EdgeLeading`, `EdgeTrailing`, or `EdgeAuto`, the default — and
the popover still takes the other side when only that one has room. `Arrow(false)` draws a card without an arrow,
`MaxWidth` caps the card (320 by default), `Padding` sets the space around the content (16) and `Background` its
colour ([`ColorSurface`](../../../concepts/theming/)).

## The top layer

A popover is drawn above everything else in the window, however deep in the tree its anchor is: a scroll view that
clips the anchor does not clip the popover, and a sibling painted after the anchor does not cover it. That is
`gift.Element.Overlay`, which any view can use to present something; see
[Custom Views](../../../concepts/custom-views/#presenting-above-everything). A popover costs nothing while it is
closed.
